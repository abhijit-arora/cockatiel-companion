# Functional Roadmap - Cockatiel Companion

This document outlines the planned development phases for the application, starting with the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

### **Version 1.0: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

The goal of the MVP is to deliver the core value proposition to our target user: **a new cockatiel owner who needs guidance and a simple way to track their bird's health.** We will focus on the single-user experience first.

**Core Modules & Features for MVP:**

*   **Module 1: User & Bird Profile**
    *   [x] 1.1. Basic email/password user account creation.
    *   [x] 1.3. Ability to create and edit a single bird profile. (We will build the *database* to support multiple birds, but the *UI* will only allow one for the MVP to keep it simple).

*   **Module 2: The Owner's Journey**
    *   [x] 2.2. The Guided "First 30 Days" Plan. This is a key feature for our target user.

*   **Module 3: The Care Hub**
    *   [x] 3.1. The "Smart" Daily Log (local storage only for MVP).
    *   [x] 3.2. Health & Wellness Reminders.

*   **Module 4: The Knowledge Center**
    *   [x] 4.1. Curated Resource Library. We will start with a foundational set of ~20 high-quality articles covering the most common new-owner questions.
